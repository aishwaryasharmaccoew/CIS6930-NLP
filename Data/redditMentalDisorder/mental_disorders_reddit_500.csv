Cold rage?,"Hello fellow friends üòÑ

I'm on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged (silent) borderline characteristics.

There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?

For me I will first become silent and blame myself, ""maybe if I"" or ""If I only"", ""maybe he's just not having it today"", ""maybe I simply don't get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding"". However, I find it interesting how, when someone hurts the ones I love, I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do, but rather the aggressor. In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger. I don't know whether you guys get to experience this as well? 

I have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like:

""The maximum amount of rage. it's like I blackout. I call it cold rage. No sense of pain whatsoever, pure anger. It's the point people don't recognize me anymore, because I will dissociate in anger. My field of view will become a pinpoint, I will start breathing superficially, and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me. It's disgusting and the insanity itself. I must say this only happened once in my life, when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life. He didn't even let us know what had happened, my sister just came home in that state. Then he called her and told her she's completely bonkers, instead of alarming the rest of the family. I'm shaking as I'm writing this because I know it's still the rest of anger inside me left behind. It was the first time I thought I could end someone's life. I'm extremely grateful for the fact that I didn't, but I know I shouldn't see him anywhere ever again. I try to calm myself by saying he's using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo, so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn't get it, due to development delay. But more often than not these calming thoughts don't work. He has very narcissistic tendencies. And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement. I do get therapy now though. So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again. I guess not.""

To put things in perspective: Normally I'm a shy and polite person. I never insult others, because I hate hurting them. People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should ""stand up for myself more.""

So yeah, to end this long rant with the clear questions I started it with: ""There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?""",1650356660,False,BPD

HELP! Opinions! Advice!,"Okay, I‚Äôm about to open up about many things I‚Äôve done in my past that I‚Äôm not proud of. I‚Äôm not that person anymore. In these stories I was 17 and immature as fuck. I‚Äôm now 22 with a total different take on life.

I became best friends with this girl in 2017. We were both 17 at the time. We did everything together. We smoked weed daily. Sleepovers. Longboard together. Did acid together. We did everything together. We would die for each other.

Once we robbed our mutual friends house. We stole $200 from the girls dad. I ended up telling the girl and paid her back Bc I felt bad. 

Once we robbed a building and made out with $1,500 and never got caught.

Once we robbed a house we thought was someone we knew who just robbed us. Turned out it was a fake address he gave us and we robbed a random house. We never got caught.

Once we got arrested for robbing cars off acid while drunk. We caught some fines for that. 

We did a lot of sneaky bad shit together. After the last time we got caught, we stopped doing all that shit. We were doing really well. 

Long story short this is how our friendship ended.‚¨áÔ∏è

I was dating a super toxic dude and she‚Äôd tell me to leave him all the time. Finally I left him. We went to a party and had a fucking blast. The next day I went home and sent her this whole long text about how her and her bf were toxic and that they should break up. 

She didn‚Äôt take that lightly. I don‚Äôt blame her I wasn‚Äôt nice about it and it came out of no where. We were literally fine the day before.

I ended up switching schools and she started rumors that I wanted to break them up because I wanted her boyfriend and he told everyone I tried to kiss him. Not true. He didn‚Äôt like me because she spent more time with me than him and he voiced that all the time.

Then I got with my current boyfriend HERE IT IS... I got my boyfriend to rob her house. I specifically said he could only take weed related things. No money and can‚Äôt steal from her mom. So he took two bongs and 8gs of weed. She assumed it was me right away Bc who else knew her window didn‚Äôt shut. I finally admitted to her like 5/6 months later during our graduation. When I told her, it looked like she wanted to kill me but she kept her cool on the outside.

Let‚Äôs call my best friend that I had my bf rob - Katrina
Let‚Äôs call the girl Katrina and I robbed $200 from her parents - Yazra

Yazra wasn‚Äôt mad at Katrina or Me for robbing her parents. She accepted out apology. Yazra invited me and Katrina to her graduation party. We both show up and there I gave Katrina $300 to make up for what I had robbed. She didn‚Äôt seem happy. I don‚Äôt blame her. 

It‚Äôs been 5ish years since 2017 when we were best friends. We are friends on Facebook but we don‚Äôt talk. 

Last week I shared a post that says ‚Äúif you were ever my closet friend at one point just know I think about you from time to time and hope you‚Äôre doing great things in life‚Äù and she heart reacted my post

4 days ago I saw her at the liquor store. She was right behind me in line. I was consumed in anxiety and couldn‚Äôt even bring myself to say hi or even look at her. When we first saw each other we both looked shook and then quickly looked/walked away. She also said nothing. 

I really really want to be her friend again. I cry over her all the time. I vent about her in my journals. I write letters that I think I would one day send to her but never do. 

Do you think she forgave me?

Do you think she misses me?

Do you think she could give me a chance again?

Do you think she‚Äôs even capable of trusting me again?

Don‚Äôt you think she could forgive me after everything we did to other people?

Do you think I should try to message her?

I apologized 100 times back in 2018 during graduation and at the graduation party and repaid her.

What should I say if I do message her?

I really don‚Äôt want to never message her and move on from her. She‚Äôs really special to me. I love her a lot. She was the best friend I ever had besides all the bad stuff we did. I know we are both grown up now and we wouldn‚Äôt do any more stupid reckless shit if we were friends again.

My ex got diagnosed with BPD,"Without going into detail, this diagnosis explains so much. The sudden break ups, severe mood swings, destructive and controlling behaviour - all makes a lot more sense now.

We have been on and off for the past 7 months since we broke up, but recently we‚Äôve been on and it‚Äôs genuinely felt like we‚Äôre rebuilding a meaningful connection again.

She came to me straight away after her psychology appointment to talk to me about it, and what it could mean for us in the future. She shared her insecurities and concerns about it, but also what she knows she can build on within her self moving forward. She told me with confidence that she is willing to give our relationship a good shot again, and I am too.

Being aware of her diagnosis, we can work together and with help of her psychologist it looks like she‚Äôs getting back on track again - and I‚Äôm willing to support her through all of this.

She‚Äôs asked me not to tell anyone about this at least until she‚Äôs ready, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve come here to update this subreddit.

Anyone willing to share any experiences or give any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",1650350635,False,BPD
"Is misdiagnosis of BPD common? I am asking because I was diagnosed a few years back, but I do not think I have it","(Reposting here on the larger sub on recommendation of people from the smaller sub)

I am not sure how common my story is, but I think it's more common than I would think.

I was a problem child for a lot of my childhood in school, but began to improve in middle school. I was very bad with people all my life and everyone who meets me ends up disliking me (this is not an exaggeration, this is unfortunately quite literally the case). This caused me to be a very homebound child and I grew very, very attached to my family. I was academically rather successful in HS, but socially the same. College was an unmitigated disaster for me and at the urging of someone I ""saw someone"". The last time I was evaluated was for autism and ADHD in elementary school and was given a clean bill of health, so to speak.

After two days of talking to someone, the psychiatrist said she believed I had BPD. I heard of the condition before, but I was taken aback and after several sessions asked if she stood by her assessment and she said yes (she claimed to have a bit of experience working with people with personality disorders). After our sessions ended (I saw her in secret), that was kind of it.

I began reading about BPD more and more and the more I read, the less I saw myself in the condition. Yes, I have huge issues with impulse control and have pretty dire self inflicted issues with my health. I am very clingy to people because of the fact everyone I have ever known has run away from me. I have a limited sense of self, to a certain extent, and have huge problems being alone without anyone with me. 

But otherwise, it just doesnt click all that much. I am not suicidal, I am not driven to make rash sudden decisions that screw up my life, I am not the kind of person who would quit a job just because I want to curse out my boss (I am pretty good at holding my tongue when there is something in it for me). I wouldn't say I have emotional dysregulation. I know mood swings are the calling card of the condition, and I cant say I have mood swings. 

I know you have to meet 5 of 9 criteria. I would say I meet 3 of them like a glove, 4 if we are being generous, and 5 if we are playing fast and loose. And that is just to meet the lowest threshold of the condition. 

This happened a few years ago, and I havent followed up on it, but the problems in my life havent gone away. 

I figure that I have to wrestle with whether or not I was misdiagnosed to make progress on that front. Is it a thing to be misdiagnosed? Is this a condition like ADHD, where it's over applied? I am a guy, if it makes any difference.

Thanks a lot, everyone",1650349446,False,BPD

"Has anyone done TFP? Need therapist, friends","Hi there, I would very much like to talk to anyone who has done or is doing Transference focused practice for BPD or other issues. I have tried it but haven't found a therapist who is a good fit yet and would also very much appreciate any names of therapists (any area) since it's so difficult to find TFP specialists.

I know TFP is supposed to be a challenging and non-supportive therapy, but so far I've found it very difficult, at times I honestly have felt like I'm going crazy (perhaps from the inherent message you get that you don't know reality as well as the therapist) but I really don't want to self-sabotage and quit.

In case it's interesting to hear my experience, I've briefly seen a female therapist in Mexico who disappeared when she didn't have availability and a man currently in the U.S. who has made me uncomfortable by repeatedly asking me about my sex life (mostly at the beginning but it's hard now because I don't feel I can discuss similar topics since I've been pressured) and who at times comes off as sarcastic, he has no Google reviews but was the only person I could find and is in my neighborhood but all my TFP sessions have been online so I'm happy to talk to anyone in the world.

I did something bad and I can't stop crying pls help," 

My long time friend came over to visit for two weeks and we got into a big argument because I tell myself that he doesn't care about me and that I might as well fuck everything up now since I know I'm going to fuck it all up later. He left to his uncles house, which is understandable, but at the same time I wanted him back because I don't actually want to be alone and I couldn't stop crying. I got really upset and sent his girlfriend a sex video of us and told her he likes to have her on the phone while having sex with other people, which is true, and I know it's out of line for me to do that but in my head at the moment I just thought I'm not seeing him again anyway so I'm going to extra fuck everything up. Now I can't stop crying because I know I really fucked up now but at the same time I wasn't going to see him again anyway. I don't know what to do.

He's hurt me a lot in the past too but I don't want to make excuses. I didn't want to feel abandoned again and I knew it would happen so I self sabotaged and now I'm like why the fuck did I DO THAT??

I know this post is all over the place but I really can't think straight right now. Let me know if I need to clarify something or something like that.

Ending day long spirals,"Hey. So life is pretty rough and has been getting progressively worse for the last 8 years. Lately I've been getting literally spirals from the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep. Every single day. It's causing so many issues for me to even function. I try coping mechanisms, deep breathing doesn't help. It's stopping me from doing anything creative... The finished project just ends up a disaster because I can't get into any kind of flow which only makes me belittle myself more. 

Sadly I don't really have any support I can go to. I'm in therapy but sadly I can only have a session every few weeks. I don't have any friends or a family i can speak to. Meditation I try to get in when I can (I'm in a chaotic house with no privacy) it sometimes helps but usually the spiral over runs it and often the house is too loud. 

I'm also unemployed with no money so getting out to get a coffee or something isn't an option. Walks in nature help but often the spirals come back the moment I get home. I would happily do them for longer but I'm worried it'll get to the expense of my daily life. 

I'm spamming this group lately because I'm getting into these spirals and I don't know what else to do with that cursed mindset...

We started dating when I was a Junior in high school and I'm currently finishing up my freshman year of college. They're a senior in high school and our relationship has worked with very few problems over the years.

But of course with time, she started being very distant and I felt she was abandoning me and I told her and I tried everything for her not to leave me. 

I think she started hating me because I was so emotionally attached. And I don't know if I was imagining it all, but I messed everything up back then and it hurt so much. I just hated myself, because of all the harm I may have brought to her when I felt I hated her, all the jealousy and horrible feeling I had, that caused fights.

We took some time apart from each other, which hurt because I only felt happy the days we talked. I tried to distance my thoughts from her and talk to other people. A month ago I thought I was completely okay and she wasn't my favourite person anymore.

 We started to talk again and we were pretty good friends for a while until I felt I had feelings for her. I had fallen in love, and she was my everything. It felt so good and I thought I was finally okay. Yesterday she hadn't answered a text of mine for hours, and I wasn't mad. But I realized she may have been active talking to other people without answering me and I started hating her. I blocked her and I just wanted to cry.

I am at a crossroads in my life: I either keep putting fingers in my ears and insisting that I don't need to change, and thus getting divorced and being completely alone, *or*, I can make the damn changes, make amends, and have the family, friends, and husband I love, want, and need.

It's time to make my indecisive ass choose something for once.

For those of you who have successes and have been able to make amends in damaged relationships, and have made changes in yourself; what are some ways I can be better about my illness and more aware of the effect I have without hiding from it? How can I be a better person for the people who love me dearly, but are very tired and hurt?

Thank you so much.",1650310824,False,BPD
New Here - Seeking Advice,"Hey everyone.  I am undiagnosed but interested in finding out more about BPD and its treatment. Can anyone suggest some resources for me?

Not sure how much information I should include here, but I am open to discussing anything about my situation if it can help me or others. I am a 36M (sometimes my reddit avatars are female which confuses some).  I live in rural East Tx which is an underserved area for mental health, so in-person therapy may not be feasible. I would consider online therapy but would likely need to save up first since I always seem to explode and quit jobs or get fired due to another dwi or stint in treatment - so no insurance and limited cash flow.  I have a history of self-harm in the form of IV drug abuse and experience hella mood swings that can spiral out of control quickly.  I did experience sexual abuse as a child, although I downplayed it for many years.  I have a laundry list of harms that medical doctors have committed against me, so I guess I'm looking for books that can help guide me at this point. 

Thank you in Advance.",1650310262,True,BPD

What level of identity confusion do you experience as a symptom of BPD?,"I have BPD but I was also professionally diagnosed with DDNOS (now known as OSDD) at a younger age.

I was just wondering if anybody can share their experiences with what BPD's identity confusion is and what that feels like. I feel like I have times where I am still aware of myself and am able to know that even if I'm acting strange I'm still the same being, but other times I feel like I completely forget everything about my life and struggle to find the connection between me and people around me because I either can't remember or just can't associate myself with past experiences.

am I in the wrong? I don't know anymore.,"I feel like I can't see clearly and I don't know if I'm in the wrong or not anymore.

Yesterday my husband and I got in an argument. I feel like I don't get any time for myself (we have an 8 month old and a dog that just had major surgery. My husband is off work with an injury for the last 4 months)
I was up with our son at 6am. Got him ready for the day, let out the chickens, come back in and made pancakes for everyone. When breakfast was ready he said didn't  feel good (injury I assume) and took his breakfast out on the deck and smoked a joint (its around 8am by now). This was a bit upsetting to me as I thought we would have breakfast together...and why is he smoking weed so early? I don't know, I was a bit sulky. He stayed out there for about an hour then came in to start his physio. For whatever reason, this took until 2pm or later. I was gradually getting more upset and feeling more and more  like my time doesn't matter and I'm just expected to be the one that takes care of the baby, makes the meals, cleans the house etc.
These have been ongoing feelings for me since our son was born. 
I am the one getting up throughout the night and in the mornings.  I put him to bed and feed him his meals and give him baths and get him dressed. I feel like I'm not asking a lot to have a couple of hours to myself once in a while. 
Around 4 kiddo had a nap so I went to get some gardening done. Finally. 
This argument isn't over though, we don't talk for the rest of the night. He watches the baby for an hour when he wakes from nap. 6:30 rolls around and I come in to get our son, feed  him dinner  and get him in bed for 8:30. I go straight to bed as well. 

This morning I woke up at 6. Husband is already up. Try to go into kitchen to get coffee going going breakfast for our kid. He shoves me and tells me to fuck off. Told him I have to get breakfast for our son and he picks up a box of baby food pouches and throws them at me..  after this I take our son and go into the bedroom and lock the door. I was in an extremely abusive relationship in my early 20s and this behaviour scares me. He starts blasting really aggressive music and said if I turn it off he will end me...
All of this seems like a completely irrational and aggressive reaction to a pretty normal argument for new parents to have.
He then told me he pulled wires under the hood of the car so I can't leave. I wasn't trying to, but this is also scary for me. We only have one vehicle currently and live rurally. 
The music is still blasting, I'm hiding in the bedroom trying to keep it together.
Music is blasting for about 2hrs while he does his physio. Then, before he leaves he bangs on the door until I open it since he would just come in through the door that goes onto the deck if I didn't. He says some incredibly hurtful things, like, that I deserved to be abused by my ex (he fractured my skull and almost killed me) and that I am exactly like my mother (who I have been estranged from since I was 12)
Then he said he 'definitely didn't piss on my toothbrush'...? Needless to say I have thrown it out...

Then he takes the car and leaves. 

I want to tell you, I have definitely caused my fair share of problems in the history of our relationship. I have CPTSD, depression, and of course, BPD. I am on medication and have gone to therapy and have come a long way in the last 6 years.
My question is... did I cause this? 
Did I bring this upon our marriage and upon my beautiful son with things I have done in the past?
Am I not understanding that I hurt him somehow the day before by being upset?

my fp is being mean to me for no reason,"My fp has been really insensitive towards me these past days.

He does not not have bpd and from my understanding isnt dealing with anything stressful.

He has been texting me WAYYY too little past week whivh has fucked my mentality up a lot. I am currently trying to hheal from trauma from being forced to leave my own home from very late november to late february by the government. I have 5 different government workers harassing me everyday, i cannot catch a break, i dont wanna tell him because i feel embarrassed. Ive asked him multiple times to talk to me more because its harming my state a lot, which he has responded to with ''ill try'' ''alright'' but never doing it. 

yesterday was really bad and i relapsed and he didnt even bother reading abt it(online only fp). he does not pay attention to stuff i say and is fucking insensitive. Hes mean to me for no reason, this has never happened. he used to be the opposite of what hes doing rn. he keeps leaving me on seen and giving half assed neeutral responses. earlier i in a sarcastic way said hes mean to me becaue he left me on seen once again, when i asked a question. he said he doesnt care when i mentioned once again that i hate when he does that bc i start unhealthily overthinking ( he has never done this before). his response broke me, he genuinely word to word said ''if you are gonna get worked up from stuff like this i cant tolerate that'

i dont have friends to talk to, my only friend of 13 years left me and i didnt get a reason. its gonna be his bday in 2 days, i feel like hes gonna ignore me all day. today i had to take a day off and just whined all day abt it. he said he doesnt like talking to me anymore, ''all i do is whine'. i fucking whine becayuse u treat me like trash. i got so worked up i started sobbing out loud again but i gave up. i tried to make a normal convo, since ive been really fucking lonely i asked to do smth with him, he agreed, hes not gonna fucking do it i swear. 

i just want to feel loved once again. i dont understand why he is being so fucking rude to me for no fucking reason, i feel like im going insane. i cant take this anymore, i dont wanna leave him because i still care abt him (in a romantic relationship), (he knows abt my bpd.)",1650304033,False,BPD

He was trying to be supportive but I was very closed up and anxious ) 

It‚Äôs like the rational part of my brain tells me I‚Äôm overreacting and i know it‚Äôs true but the irrational part of me keeps telling me that he‚Äôs fed up with me and plans on leaving ASAP.

Expanding BPD Narratives in Research,"Hi Everyone!

My name is Hannah Kitcey. I am currently getting my doctorate in psychology and doing my dissertation on BPD. I think that lack of adequate research and people who are actually diagnosed with BPD being left out of research (not getting the space to tell their stories) is what leads to a lot of misunderstandings and stereotypes. I want this research to be useful as a whole but also to each individual who chooses to participate.  Below is a little about my project.

**Who**: Individuals ages 18+, currently have or have had a BPD diagnosis

**What you will be doing**: 1 interview aimed at understanding your unique perspectives and experiences; 1 debrief meeting involving artistic elements 

**Time**: Meeting times will be determined by the comfort and schedule of the participant, not to exceed 1-2 hours  

**Location**: online available for safety and participant comfort (Zoom platform)

**Why**: To use personal narratives and artistic exploration to create open dialogue

If you are interested in being a participant in my study or have any questions, please reach out to me on here or via my email [hgkitce@pointpark.edu](mailto:hgkitce@pointpark.edu)",1650300001,False,BPD

These roleplaying ""phases"" (for lack of a better word) can last anywhere from hours to months, and at this point my life is revolving around playing these certain roles and creating these narratives. 

Even though my traits can be static, they also change around these roles. My speaking, mannerisms, and even coping skills change with each persona I put on. I also dress up my body and change it to fit the narrative I'm creating. I even tailor things as small as my phone homescreen and my music ""taste"".
